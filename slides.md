# Tango

Precise Performance Measurement through Direct Comparison

<!--
Thank people.

Thank organizers.

Introduce myself. I'm intrested in benchmarking.

Introduce a novel way of measuring performance.
-->

---

# How do we measure performance?

```rust {3-5|2,6}
fn measure(f: impl Fn()) -> u64 {
    let start = Timer::now();
    for _ in 0..iterations {
        black_box(f());
    }
    Timer::now() - start
}
```

# Wrong assumptions üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Performance measurements are **not** independent **nor** they identically distributed.

| System Level | Examples |
| --- | --- |
| Hardware | [DVFS]{.yellow}, [TDP]{.red}, [SMT]{.yellow}, [i/d cache invalidation]{.red} |
| OS | [paging]{.yellow}, [interrupt handling]{.yellow}, [NUMA allocation]{.yellow}, [task scheduling]{.yellow} |
| Runtime | [JIT]{.yellow}, [GC]{.yellow}, [task scheduling]{.green} |
| Compiler | [i/d alignment]{.green}, [inlining]{.green}, [vectorization]{.green}, [instruction scheduling]{.yellow}, [monomorphoization]{.green} |

<style>
th {
    font-weight: bold;
}

.red {
    color: red
}

.yellow {
    color: orange
}

.green {
    color: green
}
</style>

# **Solution**: Control as much as you can

- **disable**: SMT, DVFS, Power Saving, ...
- **pin**: core, NUMA, IRQ, ...
- **randomize everything else**: vmap/stack allocation, ...

# ‚úÖ Better solution

## Run **2 algorithms** you want to compare _simultaneously_.

By calculating [candidate]{.candidate}-[baseline]{.baseline}, most of the common mode noise will be _automatically eliminated_.

h2 {
    padding: 2rem 0;
}
.baseline {
    color: darkgreen;
    font-weight: bold;
}
.candidate {
    color: darkred;
    font-weight: bold;
}

# Conclusion

- computers were never designed to reproduce performance
- performance measurements are not i.i.d.
- compare apples to apples
