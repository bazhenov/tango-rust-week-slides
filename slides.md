# Tango

Precise Performance Measurement through Direct Comparison

<!--
Thank people.

Thank organizers.

Introduce myself. I'm intrested in benchmarking.

Introduce a novel way of measuring performance.

# How do we measure performance?

```rust {3-5|2,6}
fn measure(f: impl Fn()) -> u64 {
    let start = Timer::now();
    for _ in 0..iterations {
        black_box(f());
    }
    Timer::now() - start
}
```

# Wrong assumptions üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Performance measurements are **not** independent **nor** they identically distributed.

| System Level | Examples |
| --- | --- |
| Hardware | DVFS, Power Management, SMT, i/d cache invalidation, i/d alignment |
| OS | paging, interrupt handling, NUMA allocation, task scheduling |
| Runtime | JIT, GC, task scheduling |

# Solution

## Control as much as you can <v-click>ü´§</v-click>

- disable SMT/DVFS/Power Saving
- core/NUMA/IRQ pinning
- randomize everything else

<v-after>

## ‚úÖ Run both algorithm you want to compare simultaneously

By subtracting one measurement from the other, most common mode noise in the measurements will be automatically eliminated.
